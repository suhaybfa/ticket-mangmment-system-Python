Ticket Sales Management System (TSMS)

Project Overview: Developed a Python-based automation tool to transition ticket sales from manual spreadsheets to a centralized digital platform. The system manages the entire sales lifecycle, from secure user authentication to persistent data storage and visual business intelligence.

Key Technical Contributions:
* Secure Authentication: Designed a Tkinter-based GUI login with a 3-attempt security lockout to protect sensitive sales data.
