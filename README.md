<h1>Ticket Sales Management System (TSMS)</h1>

<h2> Overview</h2>
<p>
Developed a Python-based automation tool to transition ticket sales from manual spreadsheets
to a centralized digital platform. The system manages the entire sales lifecycle, starting from
secure user authentication to persistent data storage and visual business intelligence reporting.
